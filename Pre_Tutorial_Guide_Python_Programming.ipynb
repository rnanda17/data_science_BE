    "\n",
    "Welcome to the Data Science course!\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to give you a **gentle introduction to Python programming** and an **overview of basic data analysis using Pandas**. It is intended to help you get started with the tools and concepts you’ll be using throughout the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🗓️ When to Complete This\n",
    "\n",
    "You are expected to go through and understand this notebook **during the first week of the course i.e. 7-11 April**. During the first tutorial on 15th April, you’ll solve hands-on exercises from another tutorial that build on the concepts introduced in this notebook and in the assigned DataCamp sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebooks is **not part of the formal teaching time** and contains **no exercises** or assessments. It is meant to be solved as a take-home exercise during the first week of the course.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Basic Python syntax (variables, data types, conditionals, loops, functions)\n",
    "- Working with lists and dictionaries\n",
    "- Reading and exploring data with Pandas\n",
    "- Accessing and querying data with Pandas\n",

    "## ✅ What You Need to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Work through this notebook at your own pace.** Try out the code examples, and make sure you understand what each line is doing.\n",
    "2. **Complete the assigned DataCamp sessions** listed on the canvas platform. These will reinforce what you learn here.\n",
    "3. **Bring your questions to the lecture or tutorial session!** The tutorial will focus on solving problems using what you’ve learned, so make sure you’re familiar with the basics beforehand.\n",

    "> 💡 Tip: Feel free to experiment with the code as you go! Modify examples, try new things, and make mistakes — it’s the best way to learn.\n",

    "**Note that programming follows a different approach compared to other disciplines or courses. Programming isn't learned by reading books and expecting to know everything, but rather by putting it into practice. It is a highly iterative learning process. Even the most experienced programmers get stuck all the time and then have to consult the documentation of the used programming libraries (e.g., `pandas`), turn to online communities like `StackOverflow`, or ask `ChatGPT`. When you use such online resources, MAKE SURE THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DO WHAT YOU DO. For example, when using ChatGPT, then ask it to explain the outputs to you. If you don't do this, your learnings from this course will be very limited.**"
