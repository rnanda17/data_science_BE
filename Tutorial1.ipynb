    "- Access, slice and index Pandas DataFrames\n",

    "## Task 1: Calculate Total Order Price with Tax\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a Python function called `calculate_price` that calculates the **total price of an order**, including tax.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements:\n",
    "- The function should take **three arguments**:\n",
    "  - `quantity` (int): The number of items being purchased.\n",
    "  - `price` (float): The price of a single item **before tax**.\n",
    "  - `tax` (float): The tax as a decimal (e.g., `0.1` means 10% tax). Tax is always between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- The function should return a **float** representing the **total price of the order including tax**.\n",

    "## Task 2: Handling Invalid Input\n",
    "\n",

    "What should happen if someone tries to calculate the total price using a **negative quantity**?\n",

    "Currently, the `calculate_price` function does not check for this. Let‚Äôs improve it by adding **input validation**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Your Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Modify the `calculate_price` function so that it checks whether the `quantity` is a **positive number**. If the `quantity` is negative:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print an error message like: `\"Quantity must be positive!\"`\n",
    "- Return `None` instead of calculating a price\n",

    "```python\n",
    "calculate_price(-2, 10, 0.1)  # Output: \"Quantity must be positive!\" and returns None\n",
