    "\n",
    "**Correlation** refers to a statistical relationship between two variables ‚Äî how they move or change in relation to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding correlation is important in data analysis and modeling because it helps identify potential connections between variables. These connections can exist for various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One variable may directly **influence or depend on** another.\n",
    "- The variables might have a **weak or moderate association** without direct causation.\n",
    "- Both variables could be **influenced by a third, unobserved factor**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By examining correlations, we gain insights into the structure of the data, which can guide decisions in feature selection and interpretation of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correlation measures the **direction and strength** of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "- The measure of correlation is called the **correlation coefficient**.\n",
    "- The **correlation coefficient** (also known as **Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient**, denoted as *r*) measures the **strength of the linear relationship** between two continuous variables.\n",
    "- The **degree of relationship** is expressed by a value called *r*, which satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  -1 \\leq r \\leq 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "  - \\( r = 1 \\): Perfect positive linear relationship  \n",
    "  - \\( r = -1 \\): Perfect negative linear relationship  \n",
    "  - \\( r = 0 \\): No linear relationship\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **The correlation coefficient `r` is equal to the covariance of `X` and `Y`, divided by the product of the standard deviations of `X` and `Y`.**\n",
